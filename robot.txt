# How to Use BirdHouse to Control a Robot #

use birdhouse_robot.py as a template

to control the movement of the robot:
make either an external program or a function within the file
for each directional movement, making sure you account for the 
distance specified in the tweet. since i dont know the libraries
or languages involved in the projects in which you will control 
the robot, i leave all the freedom up to you while using this as 
a base. to email me your code to feature on this project, email 
me at odinsecurity@protonmail.com with a proof of concept of the 
robot following said instructions.


extra ideas to think of when contributing:
-make a more casual way to tweet that the robot will still understand
-make, in essence, a "say" command for your robot using twitter
-use twitter to control an LED display
-make a way for your robot to autonomously operate and tweet diagnostics
